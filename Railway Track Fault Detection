# Railway Track Fault Detection

In this project, I used Python and TensorFlow to classify images.

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/salmaneunus/railway-track-fault-detection

<b>Libraries and requirements</b>

<b>Environement</b>: Python 3.7 TensorFlow 2.4.1 (GPU support)

<b>Introduction</b>
We are just going to classify the railway tracks based on images. We are using a CNN model so that we can improve our training percentage to 80%.

<b>Our Algorithm:</b>

1.Understand the data

2.Preprocess the data

3.Build the architecture of the model

4.Test the model

5.Iterate the same process until you achieve the optimal results

<b>Data Visualization</b>


<b>Conclusion</b>

I have made the training accuracy to 82%. That is to a maximum value!

By having such a model, accidents can be reduced.

Data Augmentation has also been done for better generalization.

It contains more images than previous benchmarks, and the images have a higher resolution.
